Team Member Contributions:
--------------------------
 No Team Members failed to meet expectations. 
 Reno Raksi did go above expectations. He assisted with fixing Frontend bugs, helped me finish up the makefile. and provided neccesary fixes for the 
 HashTableMap class.
 Lily and Yuven also did a great job learning on the fly and making sure they were staying on track. They also 
 helped with Backend bugs and editing the makefile. 
 Everyone filled their roles well, delivered their parts on time and correctly, and collaborated well to deliver the finished product.
